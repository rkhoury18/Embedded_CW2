### Identification of tasks performed by system and their method of implementation (Thread or Interrupt)

### Characterisation of each task: theoretical minimum initiation interval and measured maximum execution time

### Critical instant analysis of the rate monotonic scheduler

### CPU utilisation. 

### Identification of shared data structures and methods used to guarantee safe accessand synchronisation.

### Analysis of inter-task blocking dependencies and possibility of deadlock
